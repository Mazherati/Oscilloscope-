        <h3>Chapter 1: Introduction</h3>
        <div>
        <h4>1.0 General Device Specifications:</h4>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Input Voltage: +/-3.5V</li>
                <li>Bandwith: 20MHz</li>
                <li>Resolution: 12 bits</li>
                <li>Usb 1.1</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h4>1.1 Set Up</h4>
        <div>
            <p>Connect the device to the PC using the included usb cable and launch the application. 
                If you launch the application without the device connected, an error message will appear asking you to connect the device.</p>
        </div>


        <h4>1.2 Boot Up</h4>
        <div>
            <p>The program will start with all parameters set to zero. The application will not be recording
                any voltages on initial boot up.
            </p>
            <p>To begin reading voltages press the start button. At this point the LCD
                screen will begin displaying incoming voltages.
            </p>
        </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Chapter 2: Controls</h3>
        <div>
         <h4>2.0 Waveform Display</h4>
         <div>
         <p>Once the application has been set to read incoming voltages, a trigger level can be set
             and a trigger function selected to begin the waveform display.
         </p>
        </div>

        <h4>2.1 Trigger level</h4>
         <div>
             <p>
                Before selecting a trigger function, it is best to set a trigger level.
                The trigger level can be set using the spin box labeled "Trigger".
             </p>
             <p>The high state of the waveform will be the portion of the waveform above
                 the set trigger level, and the low state will be the portion of the waveform 
                 below the set trigger level. The max allowable trigger level value is 99.99V.
             </p>
             <p>Once a trigger level has been set, it will be visible as a red line set at 
                 the trigger level selected. </p>
         </div>


         <h4>2.2 Trigger Functions</h4>
         <div>
         <p>To display the waveform there are 3 trigger function options;</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Continuous - Application will begin continuously graphing incoming data. Graphing will not stop
                 until stop button is pressed or different trigger function is selected.
             </li>
             <li>Falling Edge - Waveform capture will occur once the signal transitions from
                 the high state to the low state.
             </li>
             <li>
                 Rising Edge - Waveform capture will occur once the signal transitions from the low state to the high state.
             </li>
         </ul>
         </div>

         <h4>2.3 Scaling</h4>
         <div>
             <p>By default, the x-axis is set with a scaling of 8 seconds, and the y-axis is 
                 set with a scaling of 5V.
             </p>
             <p>When setting the scaling for the x-axis, there is an internal multiplier
                 of 10 to account for the spin box having a max allowable value of 99.99.
             </p>
         </div>

         <h4>2.4 Mouse Zoom & Drag</h4>
         <div>
             <p>
                To enable zoom and drag mouse features, waveform capture must be paused
                using the stop button. Once waveform capture is suspended, right-click to drag and
                zoom using the mouse's scroll wheel will be enabled.
             </p>
             <p>
                 Once waveform capture is resumed, mouse features will again be disabled,
                 and graph will reset to either default or user set x/y scaling.
             </p>
         </div>
